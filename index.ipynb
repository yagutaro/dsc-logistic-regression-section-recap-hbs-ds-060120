    "\n",
    "* In this section you learned about a different supervised learning technique: classification! Specifically, you practiced building a very basic classification model from scratch - a logistic regression model \n",
    "* Logistic regression uses a sigmoid function which helps to plot an \"s\"-like curve that enables a linear function to act as a binary classifier\n",
    "* You can evaluate logistic regression models using some combination of precision, recall, and accuracy\n",
    "* A confusion matrix is another common way to visualize the performance of a classification model\n",
    "* Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) can be used to help determine the best precision-recall tradeoff for a given classifier\n",
    "* Class weights, under/oversampling, and SMOTE can be used to deal with class imbalance problems"
